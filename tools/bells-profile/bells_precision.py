"""Does confidence-gated prefetching pay once the bus has spare capacity?

The predictor this project removed was judged on RECALL - "does my top-N contain the experts
this token needs?" It scored 68-77% and still lost every wall-clock benchmark, and the
conclusion drawn was that prediction does not work.

That conclusion is too broad, for two reasons.

**Recall is the wrong metric.** What decides whether prefetching pays is PRECISION: of the
experts fetched, what fraction get used. Recall rewards fetching more; precision rewards
fetching less. Optimising recall is precisely how you end up moving a superset, which is the
mechanism that killed it.

**The regime was wrong too.** At the ~60% hit rates measured then, the bus was saturated with
demand traffic, so every speculative byte displaced a needed one. At a high hit rate that is no
longer true. Qwen3-Next at 192 slots:

    48 layers x 10 active x 9% miss x 1.09 MB = 47 MB/token
    47 MB / 7.09 GB/s = 6.6 ms, against 24.2 ms/token of decode
    -> the bus is idle ~73% of the time

Spare bandwidth means a wrong prefetch costs idle capacity rather than displacing a needed
transfer, while a right one removes a stall from the critical path. Small experts make each
wrong guess cheaper still.

So this measures, per confidence threshold:
  - precision  : of what we would prefetch, how much is used
  - coverage   : of the misses, how many we would have converted to hits
  - bytes      : whether the speculative traffic fits inside the idle capacity

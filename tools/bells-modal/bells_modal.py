"""BELLS benchmark on Modal.

The question this exists to answer: does an expert cache beat plain layer offloading at
the SAME VRAM budget? Locally we only ever compared against --cpu-moe, because a 6 GB card
can't hold enough of these models for -ngl to be a real option. On a 24 GB card it is, and
it's the honest competitor.

Caveat that applies to every number this produces: the A10G instance has 8 vCPU. A slow CPU
inflates every BELLS result, because BELLS wins by moving work off the CPU. Cloud numbers
are not desktop numbers.

    modal run bells_modal.py::build          # warm the image, no GPU
    modal run bells_modal.py::fetch_model    # download into a Volume, no GPU
    modal run bells_modal.py::bench          # the actual measurement, GPU

Image builds are CPU-only on purpose: nvcc cross-compiles fine without a GPU present,
and GPU minutes are the expensive part.

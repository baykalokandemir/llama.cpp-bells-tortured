// BELLS: a per-layer VRAM expert cache.
//
// Each MoE layer keeps n_slot experts resident out of n_expert. Routing ids are rewritten
// through slot_table() inside the graph, so mul_mat_id runs over the small cache tensor
// instead of the full expert stack.
//
// Two invariants the graph depends on, both enforced here:
//   - the expert -> slot mapping is injective. Two experts sharing a slot would produce
//     duplicate ids within a token, which the CUDA mul_mat_id kernel cannot represent.
//   - after ensure(), every requested expert is resident. A miss leaves slot -1, which
//     indexes out of bounds. There is no safe sentinel.

// in. Hit rate was the wrong objective. Demand loading moves exactly the experts a token
// needs; a predictor moves a superset, and on a bandwidth-bound path the extra traffic costs
// more than the extra hits save.
//
// It is deleted rather than left switched off because a flag that never helps is a trap for
// whoever reads this next. tools/bells-profile/bells_predict.py still scores prediction
// against LRU and Belady offline, which is where that question belongs. Git history has the
// runtime if anyone wants to revisit it with a cheaper transfer path.
//
// A drop_missing mode went with it: a non-resident expert contributed nothing instead of being
// fetched, which removed the per-layer host sync and was the fastest thing this project ever
// measured. It was also a broken model - perplexity 52.97 against a baseline of 2.03, with
// generations collapsing into repetition loops. It could not have survived anyway, since
// prefetch was the only way an expert ever became resident in that mode.

// Token id -> per-layer expert candidates, each with a confidence.
//
// The predictor removed from this project stored a ranked list and nothing else, so it could
// only be used as "prefetch the top N" - which is precisely how it ended up moving a superset of
// what was needed and losing on wall clock. It was also judged on recall, the metric that
// rewards fetching more.
//
// This one carries P(expert used | token, layer) so the runtime can prefetch only where it is
// confident. Offline on a held-out split that gives 73.9% precision at a 0.90 threshold, and
// removes 26.8% of demand traffic at an 8x cache ratio where the bus has room to spare. At a 2x
